          This installation procedure is used to transfer the contents
     of the companion diskettes onto a harddisk or another floppy drive.

          The installation program used to install @name,
     INSTALL, is licensed software provided by:

     You may press the [Esc] key at any time to abort the
     installation.

     If you do not wish to install this disk on your harddrive
     either use this program to install on another floppy other
     than the source drive.  If you don't have a second floppy
     drive just use the regular diskcopy to make a backup of the
     original and use this as your working disk.

          By a special arrangement with author Eric Isaacson, we are
     including an evaluation versions of his A86 assembler and D86 debugger.
     If you decide to use these products to write your own programs, you   
     should purchase them from Mr. Isaacson, at the address given in the  
     documentation for those programs.  The complete package costs $90.00,
     and includes some extra utilities not found in this evaluation version.

          Before using A86 to assemble the source code listed in the book,
     it may be necessary to make minor changes.  The macros, for example,
     in AO3.ASM need to be modified.  A converted listing for this program
     can be found on the disk, titled AO3_A86.ASM.  ASCIIORG.ASM will require
     no modifications.  Due to the complexity of changes that are required
     for AO2.ASM, it has not been converted.  It is suggested that you wait
     until you have a good understanding of both assembly language and the
     A86 assembler before attempting this.  Mr. Isaacson has provided
     extensive documentation for the A86 assembler.  Please refer to this
     documentation with any questions concerning the use of this product.

     On which disk drive do you wish to install @Name:
     















     Use the [Up Arrow], [Down Arrow], [Pg Up], & [Pg Dn] keys to
     move the bar to the disk drive you wish to install to and then press
     the [Enter] key.
@EndOutDrive
@GetSubdir
     @CLS

     Now you need to specify the destination subdirectory where the
     @Name system will be installed.
